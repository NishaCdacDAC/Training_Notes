Normalization: It is the technique to remove or reduce duplicacy 
from the table.


Anomalies present in an unnormalized table:

1) Insertion Anomaly
2) Deletion Anomaly
3) Updation Anomaly

Anomalies: Any problems that occur due to certain occasions.


First Normal Form (1NF):

It states that a table should not contain multivalued attributes.

Second Normal Form (2NF):

For a table to be in 2nd Normal form:

1) The table should be in 1NF.
2) All the non-prime attributes should be fully functionally dependent 
   on the primary key.
   In simple words, there must not be any partial dependencies.

Third Normal Form (3NF):

For a table to be in 3rd Normal Form:

1) The table must be in 2NF.
2) There should be no transitive dependencies between the 
   prime attribute and non-prime attribute (i.e. a non-prime attribute 
   must not be determining another non-prime attribute).


Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF): 

For a table to be in BCNF:

1) The table must be in 3rd normal form.
2) For every functional dependency(FD), LHS must be the super key.
 
Super key example:

If there is a relation R(A,B) where A ->B, then A is the super key.
