Selection Sort :- 

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

time complexity : O(n^2)

It is non-adaptive algorithm.

Algorithm : 

Follow the below steps to solve the problem:

Initialize minimum value(min_idx) to location 0.
Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array.
While traversing if any element smaller than min_idx is found then swap both the values.
Then, increment min_idx to point to the next element.
Repeat until the array is sorted.


	for(int i = 0 ; i < arr.length-1 ; i++) {
		
		int smallest = i;

		for(int j = i + 1 ; j < arr.length ; j++) {
			if(arr[j] < arr[smallest]) {
				smallest = j;
			}
		}

		int temp = arr[i];	
		arr[i] = arr[smallest];	
		arr[smallest] = temp;	
	}
