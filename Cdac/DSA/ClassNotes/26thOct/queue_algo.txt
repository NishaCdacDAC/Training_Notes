In an empty queue : front = rear = -1
take one variable : max = something and create an array of that size
 

i) enqueue operation :- 

Algorithm :

Step 1: IF REAR = MAX - 1
	Write OVERFLOW
	Go to step 
	[END OF IF]

Step 2: IF FRONT = -1 and REAR = -1
	SET FRONT = REAR = 0
	ELSE
	SET REAR = REAR + 1
	[END OF IF]

Step 3: Set QUEUE[REAR] = NUM

Step 4: EXIT


ii) dequeue operation :- 

Step 1: IF FRONT = -1 or FRONT > REAR
	Write UNDERFLOW
	ELSE
	SET VAL = QUEUE[FRONT]
	SET FRONT = FRONT + 1
	[END OF IF]

Step 2: EXIT
