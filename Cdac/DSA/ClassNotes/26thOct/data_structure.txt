Data Structures : 

1) Data structures also called data types are the particular ways of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently

2) Data structure is the actual representation of the data using the implementation and the algorithms to manipulate the data elements. 

3) They Are essential to write efficient algorithms and provide way to arrange data in main memory for efficient usage.
e.g. Tree , Queue , List , etc.


ADT (Abstract Data Type) :

1) Abstract data types (ADT) are set of values (the carrier set), and operations on these values. i.e. An ADT is a collection of data and set of operations on the data. 

2) It is a type (or class) of objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. 

3) ADT is the logical picture of the data and the operations to manipulate the component elements of the data. 

e.g. class , structure in c++ , class in java

class Student {
	private int rollno;
	private String name;

	public void showStudentDetails() {}

	public void attendLecture() {}

	public void sleepThroughLecture() {}
}
