Operations on Circular Linked List :-

1) Insertion at the beginning of the list: To insert a node at the beginning of the list, follow these steps: 

Create a node, say T. 
Make T -> next = last -> next. 
last -> next = T. 

2) Insertion at the end of the list: To insert a node at the end of the list, follow these steps: 

Create a node, say T. 
Make T -> next = last -> next; 
last -> next = T. 
last = T. 

3) traverse :-

	if(last == null)
	return;

	Node first = last.next;
	while(first != last) {
		System.out.println(first.data);
		first = first.next;
	}
	System.out.println(first.data);
