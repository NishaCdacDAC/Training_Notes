Shortest Path Finding :(greedy method - one step at a time and 1 i/p at a time to get optimal solution)

Dijkstra's algorithm : (works on directed and non-directed graph)
	It allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph.

It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.

Here vertex with shortest path is always selected then it updates the shortest path to other vertices. This updation is called "relaxation"	

	if(d[u] + c(u,v) < d[v])
		d[v] = d[u] + c(u,v)

	1(2)   2(4)   3(infinity)   
	        u     v
