10 20 30 50 40 90


element to be deleted is 30


1) 1st iteration of while loop

temp and prev are at node 10

prev = temp (i.e. prev remained at node 10)
temp = temp.next; (i.e. temp goes to node 20)


2) 2nd iteration of while loop

prev = temp (i.e. prev goes at node 20)
temp = temp.next; (i.e. temp goes to node 30)


3) 3rd iteration of while loop

temp.data is equal to the element(i.e. 30)
come out of the while loop
and delete the temp node
