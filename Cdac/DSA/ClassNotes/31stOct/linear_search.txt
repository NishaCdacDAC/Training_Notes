2 types of search :-

1) linear search :-
	
	Element to be searched is compared with every element present in the array.  

	int flag = 0;
	int i = 0;
	for(i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++) {
		if(arr[i] == element) {
			flag = 1;
			break;
		}
	}

	if(flag == 0)
		System.out.println("element was not present");	
	else
		System.out.println("element was found at index : " + i);	

	

2) binary search :-

	pre-requisite :- all elements of the array must be in ascending order
