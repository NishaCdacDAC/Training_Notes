Full Binary Tree (Strict Binary Tree) :-
	Every node has either 0 or 2 children nodes.

Almost Complete Binary Tree : 
	It is a special kind of binary tree where insertion takes place level by level and from left to right order at each level and the last level is not filled fully always. 
Almost complete binary tree is a complete binary tree till n-1 level

Complete Binary Tree :- 
	It is such a binary tree where all its level except possibly the last, have the maximum number of nodes and if all the nodes at the last level appear as far left as possible.


Note :- 
The only difference between CBT and ACBT is that a CBT might/ might not be fully filled but an ACBT will not be fully filled.


For CBT  :- (considering i starts from 0)

The left child of node i can be found at position 2i + 1
The right child of node i can be found at position 2i + 2
It is also possible to determine the parent of a node at position i using the formula:
The parent of node i can be found at position (i â€“ 1) / 2


(considering i starts from 1)

The left child of node i can be found at position 2i
The right child of node i can be found at position 2i + 1
It is also possible to determine the parent of a node at position i using the formula:
The parent of node i can be found at position i / 2
