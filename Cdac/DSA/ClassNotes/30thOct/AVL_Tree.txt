To overcome issue of Binary Search Tree , balanced BST is created by going for rotations. Rotations are done only on 3 nodes.

AVL Tree :-
	It is a type of Binary Search Tree. It is a height balanced binary search tree. 

Balance factor is calculated for each node.

balance factor = height of left subtree - height of right subtree 
bf = hl - hr = {-1,0,1}
